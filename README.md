## Process
This script processes the results from the [literature review](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/20170816_iluc_finalstudyreport.pdf) conducted for the *European Comission - DG Energy* concerning indirect land use change. 

These results are processed in order to produce the [peer reviewed paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bbb.2124) published in *Biofuels, products and refining* (citation at the end). 

## Scripts
- ***[ILUC.R](https://github.com/VassilisDaioglou/iLUC/blob/master/ILUC.R):*** Reads and processes a database of ILUC results as compiled during the literature review. 
  - *Input:* Databse of ILUC results containing ILUC factors across different crops and calculation methods
  - *Output:* Figures and summary statistics of ILUC results
